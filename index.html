        <h2 class="wide">HAPPINESS</h2>
        <p class="opacity"><i>What is happiness to be exact?</i></p>
        <p class="justify">The term <i>happiness</i> is interchangeable with “subjective well-being,” 
            which is typically measured by asking people about how satisfied they feel with their lives (evaluative), 
            how much positive and negative emotion they tend to feel (affective), and their sense of meaning and purpose (eudaimonic). 
            In her 2007 book, "The How of Happiness", positive psychology researcher Sonja Lyubomirsky elaborates, describing happiness 
            as “the experience of joy, contentment, or positive well-being, combined with a sense that one’s life is good, meaningful, and worthwhile.”</p>
        <p class="justify">Some <b>FACTS</b> about happiness!</p>
            <ol style="text-align: left; height: 350px; overflow-y: scroll; overflow-x: hidden;">
                <li>Happiness is linked to lower heart rate and blood pressure, as well as healthier heart rate variability.</li><br>
                <li>Happiness can also act as a barrier between you and germs – happier people are less likely to get sick.</li><br>
                <li>People who are happier enjoy greater protection against stress and release less of the stress hormone cortisol.</li><br>
                <li>Happy people tend to experience fewer aches and pains, including dizziness, muscle strain, and heartburn.</li><br>
                <li>Happiness acts as a protective factor against disease and disability (in general, of course).</li><br>
                <li>Those who are happiest tend to live significantly longer than those who are not.</li><br>
                <li>Happiness boosts our immune system, which can help us fight and fend off the common cold.</li><br>
                <li>Happy people tend to make others happier as well, and vice versa – those who do good, feel good!</li><br>
                <li>A portion of our happiness is determined by our genetics (but there’s still plenty of room for attitude adjustments and happiness-boosting exercises!).</li><br>
                <li>Smelling floral scents like roses can make us happier.</li><br>
                <li>Those who are paid by the hour may be happier than those on salary (however, these findings are limited, so take them with a grain of salt!).</li><br>
                <li>Relationships are much more conducive to a happy life than money.</li><br>
                <li>Happier people tend to wear bright colors; it’s not certain which way the relationship works, but it can’t hurt to throw on some brighter hues once in a while—just in case!</li><br>
                <li>Happiness can help people cope with arthritis and chronic pain better.</li><br>
                <li>Being outdoors – especially near the water – can make us happier.</li><br>
                <li>The holidays can be a stressful time, even for the happiest among us – an estimated 44% of women and 31% of men get the “holiday blues.”</li><br>
                <li>Happiness is contagious! When we spend time around happy people, we’re likely to get a boost of happiness as well.</li><br>
